## Mini Project: CRUD App with TypeScript and Express

This directory contains a simple CRUD app to demonstrate:
- API creation with Express.
- TypeScript integration for routes, models, and server logic.

Files and folders:
- `server.ts`: The main server file for starting the Express app.
- `routes/userRoutes.ts`: API routes for handling user-related operations.
- `models/User.ts` and `models/Post.ts`: TypeScript models for the app.

Run the server with:
```bash
npm run start
